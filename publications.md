#### Perception Methods For Speed And Separation Monitoring Using Time-of-Flight Sensor Arrays 
([Masters Thesis](https://scholarworks.rit.edu/theses/10334/))
#### Author: [Sarthak Arora](http://arorasarthak.github.io) 
#### Advisor: Dr. Ferat Sahin
#### Abstract:
This work presents the development of a perception pipeline to passively track the partial human ground pose in the context of human robot collaboration. The main motivation behind this work is to provide a speed and separation monitoring based safety controller with an estimate of human position on the factory floor. Three time-of-flight sensing rings affixed to the major links of an industrial manipulator are used to implement the aforementioned. Along with a convolutional neural network based unknown obstacle detection strategy, the ground position of the human operator is estimated and tracked using sparse 3-D point inputs. Experiments to analyze the viability of our approach are presented in depth in the further sections which involve real-world and synthetic datasets. Ultimately, it is shown that the sensing system can provide reliable information intermittently and can be used for higher level perception schemes.

#### Speed and Separation Monitoring using on-robot Time--of--Flight laser--ranging sensor arrays 
(Accepted @[CASE 2019](https://www.ieee-ras.org/component/rseventspro/event/1488-case-2019-international-conference-on-automation-science-and-engineering))
#### Authors: _Shitij Kumar, [Sarthak Arora](http://arorasarthak.github.io), Ferat Sahin_
#### Abstract:
In this paper, a speed and separation monitoring (SSM) based safety controller using three 
time-of-flight ranging sensor arrays fastened to the robot links, is implemented. 
Based on the human-robot minimum distance and their relative velocities, a controller output 
characterized by a modulating robot operation speed is obtained. 
To avert self-avoidance, a self occlusion detection method is implemented using ray-casting 
technique to filter out the distance values associated with the robot-self and the restricted 
robot workspace. For validation, the robot workspace is monitored using 
a motion capture setup to create a digital twin of the human and robot. 
This setup is used to compare the safety,performance and productivity of various versions of 
SSM safety configurations based on minimum distance between human and robot calculated using 
on-robot Time-of-Flight sensors, motion capture and a 2D scanning lidar.

#### HRC-SoS: Human Robot Collaboration Experimentation Platform as System of Systems
(Accepted at @[SoSE 2019](http://sosengineering.org/2019/))
#### Authors: _Celal Savur, Shitij Kumar, [Sarthak Arora](http://arorasarthak.github.io), Tuly Hazbar, Ferat Sahin_
#### Abstract:
In this paper, an experimentation platform for human robot collaboration as a system of systems is presented. 
A conceptual framework describing the aspects of Human Robot Collaboration is proposed. 
These aspects are Awareness, Intelligence and Compliance of the system. Based on this framework 
case studies describing experiment setups performed using this platform are discussed. Each experiment 
highlights the use of the subsystems such as the digital twin, motion capture system, human-physiological 
data collection system and robot control and interface systems. A subsystem with the ability to 
monitor human physiological feedback during a human robot collaboration task is highlighted in detail.
