##### Abstract:
In this paper, a speed and separation monitoring (SSM) based safety controller using three 
time-of-flight ranging sensor arrays fastened to the robot links, is implemented. 
Based on the human-robot minimum distance and their relative velocities, a controller output 
characterized by a modulating robot operation speed is obtained. 
To avert self-avoidance, a self occlusion detection method is implemented using ray-casting 
technique to filter out the distance values associated with the robot-self and the restricted 
robot workspace. For validation, the robot workspace is monitored using 
a motion capture setup to create a digital twin of the human and robot. 
This setup is used to compare the safety,performance and productivity of various versions of 
SSM safety configurations based on minimum distance between human and robot calculated using 
on-robot Time-of-Flight sensors, motion capture and a 2D scanning lidar.
