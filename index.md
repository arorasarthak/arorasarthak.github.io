## Hi there!

Welcome to my projects page.

I am a Graduate Student employed as a Teaching Assistant at the Kate Gleason College of Engineering @ RIT. 
My major is Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Robotics. Most my time is spent working on my
graduate research in Human Robot Interaction and assisting other graduate and undergraduate students in Robotics.

Besides my passion for Robotics, I spend my time in photography [:camera:](https://www.instagram.com/acrossthedelta/) and making music [:musical_note:](https://soundcloud.com/auralrush).

*Here are some of my graduate projects and unpublished manuscripts:*
