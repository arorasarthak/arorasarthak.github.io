I am a Graduate Student employed as a Teaching Assistant at the [Kate Gleason College of Engineering @ RIT](https://www.rit.edu/kgcoe/). 
My major is Electrical Engineering with a specialization in Robotics. Most my time is spent working on my

Besides my passion for Robotics, I spend my time in photography and making music.
